## What it is

React Material UI documentation website on the fly. Unlike GitBook, it does not generate static html files. Instead, it smartly loads and parses your Markdown files and displays them as a website. To start using it, all you need to do is create an `index.html` and [deploy it on GitHub Pages](deploy.md).

See the [Quick start](quickstart.md) guide for more details.

## Features

- No statically built html files
- Simple and lightweight (~21kB gzipped)
- Smart full-text search plugin
- Multiple themes
- Useful plugin API
- Emoji support
- Compatible with IE11
